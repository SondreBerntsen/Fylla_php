    <!--  
        To be done:
        - styling for cards, not sure if 1.0 2.0 or 3.0, depends on which design has best image quality or whichever fits the responsive design.
        - Actual gameplay, check what is going to be best practice, session, cookies or database storage of gamestate.
        - Doublecheck player and administrator rights, right now players can see the "create new card modal trigger."
        - Session check for administrator needs to be user_type not user_id, else everyone logged in has all rights lol.
